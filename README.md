Housekeeper
===========

Housekeeper is a simple, modular configuration-based script runner application with email notification support. It was initially developed to automate basic Linux housekeeping tasks but can be extended to do pretty much anything.

Installation
============

You can use the still primitive './Install.sh' script to ensure Housekeeper dependancies are met. Currently, this ensures Ruby is installed and that all Gem dependancies are met.

Configuration
=============

Please see 'conf/housekeeper.conf'.
